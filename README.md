## üß† Algorithms

### 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Description:** Executes processes in the order they arrive. Can lead to poor performance if long processes block short ones.  
- **Use Case:** Batch systems.

### 2. Round Robin (RR)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Time-sliced scheduling with adjustable quantum (`q`). Shorter processes can get smaller quanta. Prevents starvation and improves fairness.
- **Use Case:** Time-sharing systems with better flexibility.

### 3. Shortest Process Next (SPN)
- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Description:** Executes the process with the shortest burst time next. Good for minimizing average waiting time.
- **Use Case:** Systems optimizing for average waiting time.

### 4. Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Chooses the process with the shortest remaining time. Can preempt a currently running process.
- **Use Case:** Interactive systems with variable process times.

### 5. Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Description:** Chooses the process with the highest response ratio: = Waiting¬†Time + Service¬†Time / Service¬†Time
- **Use Case:** Fair scheduling without starvation.

### 6. Feedback (FB)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Uses multiple queues and promotes/demotes processes based on behavior. Higher priority queues are served first.
- **Use Case:** Mixed process types with aging and fairness.

### 7. Feedback with Varying Time Quantum (FBV)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Similar to FB, but with increasing time quantums for lower queues. Helps balance responsiveness and fairness.
- **Use Case:** Increased control over scheduling fairness and efficiency.

### 8. Aging
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Prevents starvation by increasing the priority of waiting processes over time. Inspired by Xinu OS.
- **Use Case:** Real-time systems needing fairness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms.git
cd CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

# 2. Install required tools
sudo apt-get install g++ make

# 3. Compile the code
make

# 4. Run the program
./scheduler
```

## üìù Input Format
Line 1: "trace" or "stats" ‚Äì Mode of execution.

Line 2: Comma-separated list of scheduling policies and their parameters.

Example: 1,2-4,8-1

1 ‚Üí FCFS

2-4 ‚Üí RR with quantum = 4

8-1 ‚Üí Aging with quantum = 1

Line 3: Simulation time (last time instant on timeline).

Line 4: Number of processes.

Line 5 onwards: Process description (one per line).

For Algorithms 1-7 (FCFS to FBV):
Each process line:

``` <ProcessName>,<ArrivalTime>,<ServiceTime> ```

For Algorithm 8 (Aging):
Each process line:

``` <ProcessName>,<ArrivalTime>,<Priority> ```

Processes are sorted by arrival time.
If arrival time matches, the lower-priority process is considered first.
