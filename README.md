## üß† Algorithms

### 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Description:** Executes processes in the order they arrive. Can lead to poor performance if long processes block short ones.  
- **Use Case:** Batch systems.

### 2. Round Robin (RR)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Time-sliced scheduling with adjustable quantum (`q`). Shorter processes can be handled more responsively. Prevents starvation and improves fairness.  
- **Use Case:** Time-sharing systems.

### 3. Shortest Process Next (SPN)
- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Description:** Executes the process with the shortest burst time next. Optimized for lower average waiting time.  
- **Use Case:** Systems aiming to minimize wait time.

### 4. Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Selects the process with the shortest remaining execution time. Can preempt a currently running process.  
- **Use Case:** Interactive systems with dynamic processes.

### 5. Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Description:** Chooses the process with the highest response ratio:  
  \[
  \text{Response Ratio} = \frac{\text{Waiting Time} + \text{Service Time}}{\text{Service Time}}
  \]  
- **Use Case:** Ensures fairness while avoiding starvation.

### 6. Feedback (FB)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Multi-level queue-based scheduler. Processes are demoted to lower priority queues if they use too much CPU time.  
- **Use Case:** Fair scheduling for both short and long tasks.

### 7. Feedback with Varying Time Quantum (FBV)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Same as FB but with increasing time quantums for lower priority queues (`q = 2^i`).  
- **Use Case:** Fine-tuned control over responsiveness and efficiency.

### 8. Aging
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Prevents starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes over time. Inspired by Xinu OS.  
- **Use Case:** Real-time systems that require fairness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms.git
cd CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

# 2. Install required tools
sudo apt-get install g++ make

# 3. Compile the code
make

# 4. Run the program
./scheduler
```

## üìù Input Format
Line 1: "trace" or "stats" ‚Äì Mode of execution.

Line 2: Comma-separated list of scheduling policies and their parameters.

Example: 1,2-4,8-1

1 ‚Üí FCFS

2-4 ‚Üí RR with quantum = 4

8-1 ‚Üí Aging with quantum = 1

Line 3: Simulation time (last time instant on timeline).

Line 4: Number of processes.

Line 5 onwards: Process description (one per line).

For Algorithms 1-7 (FCFS to FBV):
Each process line:

``` <ProcessName>,<ArrivalTime>,<ServiceTime> ```

For Algorithm 8 (Aging):
Each process line:

``` <ProcessName>,<ArrivalTime>,<Priority> ```

Processes are sorted by arrival time.
If arrival time matches, the lower-priority process is considered first.
